### Configuring the Step

By default, the Step requires no configuration. To be able to use it, you only need to you have an ssh key registered with Guardsquare added to the local SSH agent. In bitrise, this can be done with the [Certificate and profile install](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-certificate-and-profile-installer) provided the private key was uploaded to bitrise.
