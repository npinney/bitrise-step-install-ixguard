  The Step downloads and installs the guardsquare and ixguard cli tools required to process and protect an xcarchive.
  You only need to specify the version of iXGuard you'd like to install and make sure an ssh key (registered with Guardsquare) is loaded into the SSH agent.
  The SSH configuration can be performed using the Activate SSH key Step.
  The Step will only perform the download and install if the cli is not installed or is not the prefered version.
